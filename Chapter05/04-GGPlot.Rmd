    1. How are runtime and box-office revenue related?
    2. Has the average box-office revenue changed over time?
    
    
*Bivariate Visualization for two quantitiative variables*
## Setting up environment

```{r}
library(lattice)
movies <- read.csv('../data/Movies.csv')
main_label <- "Runtime vs. Box Office Revenue"
runtime_in_minutes_label <- "Runtime (minutes)"
box_office_label <- "Box Office ($M)"
density_label <- "Density"
```
